3. **Flashcards & Quizzes**: Students can summarize topics into flashcards or practice with AI-generated quizzes.  
4. **Manual Assistance**: If AI cannot resolve a query, students can escalate their doubts to teachers.  
5. **Rewards System**: Every interaction with the AI or teacher contributes to a points-based reward system.
